`lyricsgenius` provides a simple interface to the song, artist, and lyrics data stored on [Genius.com](https://www.genius.com).

The full documentation for `lyricsgenius` is available online at [Read the Docs](https://lyricsgenius.readthedocs.io/en/master/).

## Setup
Before using this package you'll need to sign up for a (free) account that authorizes access to [the Genius API](http://genius.com/api-clients). The Genius account provides a `access_token` that is required by the package. See the [Usage section](https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius#usage) below for examples.

## Installation
`lyricsgenius` requires Python 3.

Use `pip` to install the package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install lyricsgenius
```

Or, install the latest version of the package from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius.git
```

## Usage
Import the package and initiate Genius:

```python
import lyricsgenius
genius = lyricsgenius.Genius(token)
```

If you don't pass a token to the `Genius` class, `lyricsgenus` will look for an environment variable called `GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN` and attempt to use that for authentication.

```python
genius = Genius()
```

Search for songs by a given artist:

```python
artist = genius.search_artist("Andy Shauf", max_songs=3, sort="title")
print(artist.songs)
```
By default, the `search_artist()` only returns songs where the given artist is the primary artist.
However, there may be instances where it is desirable to get all of the songs that the artist appears on.
You can do this by setting the `include_features` argument to `True`.

```python
artist = genius.search_artist("Andy Shauf", max_songs=3, sort="title", include_features=True)
print(artist.songs)
```

Search for a single song by the same artist:

```python
song = artist.song("To You")
# or:
# song = genius.search_song("To You", artist.name)
print(song.lyrics)
```

Add the song to the artist object:

```python
artist.add_song(song)
# the Artist object also accepts song names:
# artist.add_song("To You")
```

Save the artist's songs to a JSON file:

```python
artist.save_lyrics()
```

Searching for an album and saving it:

```python
album = genius.search_album("The Party", "Andy Shauf")
album.save_lyrics()
```

There are various options configurable as parameters within the `Genius` class:

```python
genius.verbose = False # Turn off status messages
genius.remove_section_headers = True # Remove section headers (e.g. [Chorus]) from lyrics when searching
genius.skip_non_songs = False # Include hits thought to be non-songs (e.g. track lists)
genius.excluded_terms = ["(Remix)", "(Live)"] # Exclude songs with these words in their title
```

You can also call the package from the command line:

```bash
export GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN="my_access_token_here"
python3 -m lyricsgenius --help

# Save a song in JSON format
python -m lyricsgenius song "Begin Again" "Andy Shauf" --save json

# Save an artist's lyrics to a text file
python -m lyricsgenius artist "The Beatles" --max-songs 2 --save txt

# Print a song's lyrics to stdout in text format
python3 -m lyricsgenius song "Check the Rhyme" "A Tribe Called Quest" --stdout txt
```
