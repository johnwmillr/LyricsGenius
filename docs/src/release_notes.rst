-  All requests now go through the ``Sender`` object. This provides
   features such as retries ``genius.retries`` and handling HTTP and
   timeout errors. For more info have a look at the guide about `request
   error handling`_.
-  Added ``OAuth2`` class to help with OAuth2 authentication.
-  Added ``PublicAPI`` class to allow accessing methods of the public
   API (genius.com/api). Check `this page`_ for a list of available
   methods.

   ``GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN``.

   ``genius.access_token``.

-  Lyrics won't be fetched for instrumental songs and their lyrics will
   be set to ``""``. You can check to see if a song is instrumental
   using ``Song.instrumental``.
-  Renamed all interface methods to remove redundant ``get_``
   (``genius.get_song`` is now ``genius.song``).

   users. It accepts song URLs and song IDs.
