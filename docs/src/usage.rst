   print(artist.songs)

Search for a single song by the same artist:

.. code:: python

   # Way 1
   song = genius.search_song("To You", artist.name)

   # Way 2
   # this will search artist.songs first
   # and if not found, uses search_song
   song = artist.song("To You")

   print(song.lyrics)

Add the song to the :class:`Artist <types.Artist>` object:

.. code:: python

   artist.add_song(song)
   # add_song accepts song names as well:
   # artist.add_song("To You")

Save the artist's songs to a JSON file:

.. code:: python

   artist.save_lyrics()

Searching for an album and saving it:

.. code:: python

   album = genius.search_album("The Party", "Andy Shauf")
   album.save_lyrics()

There are various options configurable as parameters within the

.. code:: python

   # Turn off status messages
   genius.verbose = False 

   # Remove section headers (e.g. [Chorus]) from lyrics when searching
   genius.remove_section_headers = True 

   # Include hits thought to be non-songs (e.g. track lists)
   genius.skip_non_songs = False

   # Exclude songs with these words in their title
   genius.excluded_terms = ["(Remix)", "(Live)"]
